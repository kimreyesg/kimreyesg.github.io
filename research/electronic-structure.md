# Electronic Structure Calculations

Electronic structure calculations are a cornerstone of modern materials science and solid-state physics. These calculations allow us to predict the behavior of electrons in a material, which is essential for understanding its properties.

Using methods like the **tight-binding model** and **density functional theory (DFT)**, researchers can study:
- Band structures and energy levels.
- Magnetic and optical properties.
- Interactions between electrons and atoms.

These tools are critical for designing new materials for applications in electronics, energy, and nanotechnology.
