# 💻🧪 Academic Website & Research Repository

Welcome!  
This repository hosts the source code for my **personal academic website**, and serves as the starting point for sharing my research, teaching materials, and computational projects in **Solid State Physics** and **Quantum Mechanics**.

## 📚 About This Project

As a new Assistant Professor of Physics, I am building this GitHub space to:

- **Track research projects** in computational physics and materials science.
- **Organize and share teaching resources** for undergraduate and graduate courses, including simulation codes, demonstrations, and course materials.
- **Maintain reproducible computational workflows** for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, phonon analysis, and quantum mechanical modeling.
- **Develop a knowledge base** that grows alongside my academic career and the one of my students, both for personal use and public benefit.

This website acts as the public-facing portal to these activities.

Other specialized repositories (for codes and simulations) will be linked from this site as they are developed.
