 # 🌐🧪🖥️ Academic Website & Research Repository

Welcome!  

This repository hosts the source code for my **academic website**, and serves as the starting point for sharing my research, teaching materials, and computational projects in **Solid State Physics**💎 and **Quantum Mechanics** 🐈.

## 📚 About This Project

I am building this GitHub space to:

- **Track research projects** in computational physics and materials science.
- **Organize and share teaching resources** for undergraduate courses, including simulation codes, demonstrations, and course materials.
- **Maintain reproducible computational workflows** for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, phonon analysis, and quantum mechanical modeling.
- **Develop a knowledge base** that grows alongside my academic career and that of one of my students, both for personal use and public benefit.

This website acts as the public-facing portal to these activities.

Other specialized repositories (for codes and simulations) will be linked from this site as they are developed.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, and minimal JavaScript for the website
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Computational tools including Python, Quantum ESPRESSO, and other DFT software for research
