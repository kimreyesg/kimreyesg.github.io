### Teaching


<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Teaching is one of my greatest passions. I want to create an interactive learning environment where students feel encouraged to ask questions, think critically, and explore the world of physics. My Quantum Physics course has been introduced alongside the use of Mathematica, which I believe will help students develop the new physics intuition required for analyzing quantum materials and many other topics.</p>
