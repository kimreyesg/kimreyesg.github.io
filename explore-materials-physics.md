  <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">The Journey of Materials</h2>
  <p>
    The study and design of materials form the backbone of modern technology.
    An incredible journey of research, meticulous attention to detail, and hard work has transformed technology into what we have today. However, many of these discoveries originate from intriguing and unexpected sources.

<h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Data-Driven Methods</h2>

<div class="card collapsed">
  <h2>Density Functional Theory</h2>
  <p>
    First-principle methods enable us to simulate electronic behavior and optical response by looping the Hamiltonian of the many-body system through the charge density.
  </p>

  <div class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      The iterative process solves the Kohn-Sham equations and updates the charge density until self-consistency is achieved.
    </p>
<pre>
Initial Charge Density ρ(r)

       ↓
Compute Effective Potential Veff(r)
Veff(r) = Ven(r) + ∫ ρ(r') / |r - r'| dr' + Vxc[ρ(r)]

       ↓
Solve Kohn-Sham Equations
[-ħ²/2me ∇² + Veff(r)] ψi(r) = εi ψi(r)

       ↓
Compute New Charge Density
ρ(r) = Σ |ψi(r)|²

       ↓
Calculate Total Energy
Etot[ρ(r)] = T[ρ(r)] + ∫ Vext(r) ρ(r) dr + Ehartree[ρ(r)] + Exc[ρ(r)]

       ↓
Check Convergence

  <h2>Machine Learning in Materials Discovery</h2>
  <p>
    Even more recently, Machine Learning techniques have transformed the landscape of materials search by predicting many prototype materials capable of optimizing and launching a new way to find new materials.

<h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Discoveries in Unexpected Places</h2>

<div class="card collapsed">
  <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Saccharin: Bad Lab Practices</h2>
  <div class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      Saccharin, the first artificial sweetener, was discovered in 1879 when Constantin Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his fingers after working with coal tar derivatives. An improper lab practice—forgetting to wash his hands—led to a revolutionary sugar substitute. It quickly became a popular low-calorie sweetener worldwide, despite some early controversies over safety.

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Stainless Steel: Rusty Experiments</h2>
  <div class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      Harry Brearley was experimenting with steel alloys for erosion-resistant gun barrels. By chance, he created steel with about 12% chromium—and noticed a discarded sample hadn’t rusted. His accidental observation gave birth to stainless steel, transforming modern society by revolutionizing kitchenware, construction, and medical devices.

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Teflon: Frozen Gases Surprise</h2>
  <div class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      In 1938, Roy Plunkett at DuPont was researching refrigerants when he opened a gas cylinder and found a slippery white powder inside instead of gas. That powder turned out to be Teflon—a material now famous for nonstick cookware and countless industrial uses, thanks to its chemical resistance and low friction properties.

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Vulcanized Rubber: Spilled Sulfur</h2>
  <div class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      Charles Goodyear accidentally dropped a rubber-sulfur mixture onto a hot stove in 1839. Instead of melting, the rubber became durable and elastic—creating vulcanized rubber, essential for tires, seals, and countless products we rely on today. This discovery revolutionized transportation and manufacturing industries.
