# Computational Solid State Physics


<div style="text-align: justify;">
Have you ever wondered why your smartphone works, how solar panels capture energy, or what makes some materials magnetic? Solid-state and materials science holds the answers.
This exciting field explores how atoms arrange themselves in materials and how these arrangements create the properties we see and use every day. 
When scientists use computers to study materials, they can:

Calculate **electronic structures** to see how electrons move through materials (this is what makes some materials conduct electricity while others don't)
Study **phonons** (sound waves inside materials) to determine if a structure will remain stable
Perform **spin-polarized calculations** to predict if a material will be magnetic and many more computational analysis.

These computer simulations let scientists "test drive" materials before making them in a lab, saving time and resources. It's like being able to design and test a car completely in a computer game before building it in real life.
The knowledge from this field directly impacts technology you use dailyâ€”from the chips in your laptop to the materials in your bike frame to the screen you're reading this on right now.
