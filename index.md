<p>Have you ever wondered why your smartphone works, how solar panels capture energy, or what makes some materials magnetic? Solid-state and materials science holds answers. This exciting field explores how atoms arrange themselves in materials and how these arrangements create the properties we see and use every day. </p>

<p>These computer simulations let scientists "test drive" materials before making them in a lab, saving time and resources. It's like being able to design and test a car completely in a computer game before building it in real life. The knowledge from this field directly impacts technology you use dailyâ€”from the chips in your laptop to the materials in your bike frame to the screen you're reading this on right now.</p>

I am assistant professor or physics in the Physics and Astronomy Department at SUNY New Paltz, and my research focuses on studying materials using computational techniques. These techniques allow us to simulate the electronic behavior, optical response, and stability of material prototypes for various applications that meet current technological needs. In addition, I am passion in teaching and combine my lectures with simulations and many problem solving sessions.



### Research

+ My research focuses on data-driven techniques to address critical challenges in materials science. These techniques are applied to several key areas, including sustainable energy storage and generation systems, catalytic devices, perovskites, defects in semiconductors, and next-generation semiconductors.
