<p>Have you ever wondered why your smartphone works, how solar panels capture energy, or what makes some materials magnetic? Solid-state and materials science holds answers. This exciting field explores how atoms arrange themselves in materials and how these arrangements create the properties we see and use every day. </p>

<p>These computer simulations let scientists "test drive" materials before making them in a lab, saving time and resources. It's like being able to design and test a car completely in a computer game before building it in real life. The knowledge from this field directly impacts technology you use dailyâ€”from the chips in your laptop to the materials in your bike frame to the screen you're reading this on right now.</p>

I am Assistant Professor of Physics in the Physics and Astronomy Department at SUNY New Paltz, and my research focuses on studying materials using computational techniques. These techniques allow us to simulate the electronic behavior, optical response, and stability of material prototypes for various applications that meet current technological needs. In addition, I am passionate about teaching and combine my lectures with simulations and many problem-solving sessions.

### Teaching

Teaching is one of my greatest passions. I believe that education is a two-way street where I not only share knowledge but also learn from my students' unique perspectives and insights. Over the years, I have had the privilege of teaching a variety of courses in English, ranging from introductory physics to quantum mechanics. My teaching philosophy emphasizes clarity, engagement, and the integration of real-world applications to make complex concepts accessible and relatable. I strive to create an interactive learning environment where students feel encouraged to ask questions, think critically, and explore the fascinating world of physics.
