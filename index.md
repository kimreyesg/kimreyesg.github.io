    <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">The Journey of Materials</h2>
    <p>
      The study and design of materials form the backbone of modern technology. The extensive effort and meticulous attention to detail in every device we use daily represent a remarkable journey of exploration, research, and calculations with, sometimes, intriguing origins.

<h2 style="font-size: 28px;">💡 Discoveries in Unexpected Places</h2>


<div class="card">
  <h2> 🍬🍭 Saccharin: Bad Lab Practices</h2>
  <p>
    Saccharin, the first artificial sweetener, was discovered in 1879 when Constantin Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his fingers after working with coal tar derivatives. An improper lab practice—forgetting to wash his hands—led to a revolutionary sugar substitute!

  <h2>🖇️👩🏻‍🏭 Stainless Steel: Rusty Experiments</h2>
  <p>
    Harry Brearley was experimenting with steel alloys for erosion-resistant gun barrels. By chance, he created steel with about 12% chromium—and noticed a discarded sample hadn’t rusted. His accidental observation gave birth to stainless steel, transforming modern society.

  <h2>🧪🍳 Teflon: Frozen Gases Surprise</h2>
  <p>
    In 1938, Roy Plunkett at DuPont was researching refrigerants when he opened a gas cylinder and found a slippery white powder inside instead of gas. That powder turned out to be Teflon—a material now famous for nonstick cookware and countless industrial uses.

  <h2>🔋🛞 Vulcanized Rubber: Spilled Sulfur</h2>
  <p>
    Charles Goodyear accidentally dropped a rubber-sulfur mixture onto a hot stove in 1839. Instead of melting, the rubber became durable and elastic—creating vulcanized rubber, essential for tires, seals, and countless products we rely on today.

    <h2> 🧠 Machine Learning in Materials Discovery</h2>
    <p>
      Even more recently, Machine Learning techniques have transformed the landscape of materials search by predicting many prototype materials capable of optimizing and launching a new way to find new materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website aims to introduce undergraduate students to solid state calculations, requiring them to understand physics, acquire computational techniques, engage in critical analysis, and cultivate curiosity about new ways of discovering materials.
