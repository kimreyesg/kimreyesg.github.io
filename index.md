    <h2>The Journey of Materials</h2>
    <p>
      The study and design of materials form the backbone of modern technology. The extensive effort and meticulous attention to detail in every device we use daily represent a remarkable journey of exploration, research, and calculations with, sometimes, intriguing origins.

  <h2> 💡 Discoveries in Unexpected Places</h2>
  <p>
    Incredible materials have emerged from surprising situations. Sometimes, science advances because of a happy accident—or an experiment gone sideways.

  <h2>🍬🍭 Saccharin: Band Lab practices</h2>
  <p>
    Saccharin, the first artificial sweetener, was discovered in 1879 when Constantin Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his fingers after working with coal tar derivatives. An improper lab practice—forgetting to wash his hands—led to a revolutionary sugar substitute!

  <h2>🖇️👩🏻‍🏭 Stainless Steel: Rusty Experiments</h2>
  <p>
    Harry Brearley was experimenting with steel alloys for erosion-resistant gun barrels. By chance, he created steel with about 12% chromium—and noticed a discarded sample hadn’t rusted. His accidental observation gave birth to stainless steel, transforming modern society.

  <h2>🧪🍳 Teflon: Frozen Gases Surprise</h2>
  <p>
    In 1938, Roy Plunkett at DuPont was researching refrigerants when he opened a gas cylinder and found a slippery white powder inside instead of gas. That powder turned out to be Teflon—a material now famous for nonstick cookware and countless industrial uses.

  <h2>🔋🛞 Vulcanized Rubber: Spilled Sulfur</h2>
  <p>
    Charles Goodyear accidentally dropped a rubber-sulfur mixture onto a hot stove in 1839. Instead of melting, the rubber became durable and elastic—creating vulcanized rubber, essential for tires, seals, and countless products we rely on today.

    <h2> 💻 Computational Materials Science</h2>
    <p>
      While these histories evoke admiration due to their roots in genuine curiosity and consistent work, today, a vast field of opportunities has emerged through computational techniques. First-principle Methods enable us to simulate electronic behavior, optical response, and stability of material prototypes for various applications projected to meet contemporary technological needs.
