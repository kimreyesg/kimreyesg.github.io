# Computational Solid State Physics

Solid-state and materials science is a fascinating field that explores the properties of materials at the atomic and molecular levels. It seeks to understand how the arrangement of atoms in a material influences its physical, chemical, and electronic properties. This knowledge is crucial for designing new materials with specific functionalities, such as semiconductors for electronics, superconductors for energy applications, and nanomaterials for advanced technologies.
