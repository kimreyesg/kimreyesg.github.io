## Welcome!

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>The study and design of materials form the backbone of modern technology. The extensive effort and meticulous attention to detail in every device we use daily represent a remarkable journey of exploration, research, and calculations with, sometimes, intriguing origins.</p>

        <p>Many essential materials have been discovered by <b>chance</b>. For instance, <b>saccharin</b> was accidentally found in 1879 by Fahlberg when he noticed a sweet taste on his hands after handling coal tar derivatives. 
        Similarly, Roy Plunkett, a chemist at DuPont, discovered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), later known as <b>Teflon</b>, in 1938 while researching refrigerants.</p>

            <p> Stainless steel revolutionized modern society.</p>

        <p>Brearley was experimenting with steel alloys to make more erosion-resistant gun barrels. He created a steel with about 12% chromium, and later noticed that a discarded sample hadn’t rusted, unlike others. This accidental observation led to the birth of <b>stainless steel</b>.</p>

 <p>While these histories evoke admiration due to their roots in genuine curiosity and consistent work, today, a vast field of opportunities has emerged through computational techniques. <b>First-principle Methods</b> enable us to simulate the electronic behavior, optical response, and stability of material prototypes for various applications projected to meet contemporary technological needs. Even more recently, <b>Machine Learning</b> techniques have transformed the landscape of materials search by predicting many prototype materials capable of optimizing and launching a new way to find new materials. This website aims to introduce undergraduate students to solid state calculations, requiring them to understand physics, acquire computational techniques, engage in critical analysis, and cultivate curiosity about new ways of discovering materials.</p>

### Research

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>My research aims to comprehend and forecast the characteristics of materials. Specifically, I’m dedicated to investigating advanced semiconductor materials, particularly intermediate band semiconductors and perovskites, understanding the electronic properties, and exploring their potential applications. Furthermore, I’m interested in studying defects in solids, which significantly influence material behavior, and employing density functional theory to study magnetic materials.</p>

### Teaching


<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Teaching is one of my greatest passions. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of teaching various courses, from introductory physics to quantum mechanics. My teaching philosophy emphasizes clarity and engagement. I strive to create an interactive learning environment where students feel encouraged to ask questions, think critically, and explore the world of physics. For instance, my Quantum Physics course has been introduced alongside the use of Mathematica, which I believe will help students develop the new physics intuition required for analyzing quantum materials.</p>
